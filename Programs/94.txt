Composites can be very strong and stiff, yet very light in weight, so
ratios of strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight are several times
greater than steel or aluminum High specific strength andHigh specific stiffness Long fatigue lifeHigh creep resistanceLow coefficient of thermal expansionLow densityLow thermal conductivityBetter wear resistanceImproved corrosion resistanceBetter temperature dependent behavior
A composite material can be defined as a combination of two or more
materials that results in better properties than those of the individual
components used alone.
Composites consist of one or more discontinuous phases
